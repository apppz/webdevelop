        Outside of Italy, cappuccino is a coffee drink that today is typically composed of a single espresso shot and hot milk, with the surface topped with foamed milk. ... Cappuccino is traditionally small (180 ml maximum) with a thick layer of foam, while
        "latte" traditionally is larger (200–300 ml)
    </p>

    <h3>LATTE</h3>

        Caffè latte is a coffee-based drink made primarily from espresso and steamed milk. It consists of one-third espresso, two-thirds heated milk and about 1cm of foam. ... Traditionally the cafe latte is a ratio of two parts coffee and one part steamed milk
        (also called a Café Au Lait).

    <p id="p3" class="p33">
        Like a caffè latte, caffè mocha is based on espresso and hot milk but with added chocolate flavouring and sweetener, typically in the form of cocoa powder and sugar. Many varieties use chocolate syrup instead, and some may contain dark or milk chocolate.
